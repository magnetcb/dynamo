	  	<h1>DYNAMO’S CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN</h1>
	  	<p>The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has exceeded the highest recorded values. Today, we are getting warning signals from nature, upon which we depend for our survival. Targeting a reduction in Dynamo’s carbon footprint, its corporate sustainability plan has been constructed around these three items: Eco-friendly Products, “Green Plant” Principles and Green Materials.

	  	<h1>ECO-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</h1>
	  		<p>At Dynamo, we have been implementing eco-friendly technologies for our manufacturing processes since 2013. With our investments in both new fabrics and eco-friendly dyeing techniques, our goal is to produce the best quality textile without creating a destructive effect on the environment. Our eco-friendly dyeing techniques and the fabrics we have recently added to our portfolio allow us to manufacture products that meet the standards of both the aesthetic and the technical quality that are expected of our industry.

	  			<h2>Eco-friendly Product Group 1</h2>
	  			<h3>Indy, N-Vaga, Besh</h3>
	  			<p>The most important aspect of this product group, which includes the textile types Indy, N-Vaga, and Besh, is that they require less water consumption during the production process. The dyeing agent is applied to the textile in the form of a foam during the production process, which results in the use of 90 percent less water compared to the reactive dyeing process.</p>
	  			
	  			<h2>Eco-friendly Product Group 2</h2>
	  				<h3>Cambi, Beoil, Gleta, Logan</h3>
	  				<p>When it comes to water savings, Cambi, Beoil, Gleta, and Logan are types of textile that take it one step further. Water consumption is reduced to a minimum, thanks to the specially-designed coating process used in the production of these textiles.</p>

	  		<h1>“GREEN PLANT” PRINCIPLES</h1>
	  		<p>The only way to achieve more sustainability is to operate a production facility according to these principles. Since 2014, Dynamo has been investing in its production facility to bring about more sustainable production processes. In order to reduce the amount of raw material waste, recycling and recovery systems have been implemented at the facility. Thanks to these systems, Dynamo products are being processed in an eco-friendlier way. The following recycling and water purification systems are being used in Dynamo’s production facility:</p>
	  	</div>
	  	
	  	<div class="row ">
	  		<div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 sec-th ">
	  			<strong>Caustic Recovery System: </strong>Dynamo recovers 60 percent of the total caustic material used in the production facility by utilizing the caustic recovery system (CRS). Caustic waste, which is normally sent to a wastewater treatment system, can be recycled by utilizing the CRS. With the implementation of the CRS, Dynamo has reduced its caustic consumption by 50 percent, and its sulphuric acid consumption by 75 percent.<br><br>
	  			
	  			<strong>Hot Water Recovery System:</strong> Prior to the implementation of the hot water recovery system, the annual water requirement for Dynamo was 44 tons, which has now been reduced to 41 tons. Some of the hot water used to power the mill turbines during the production process are provided by this recovery system. This system has also reduced energy consumption.<br><br>
	  			
	  			<strong>Heat recovery system for stenters:</strong> The heat recovery system for needle exhaust utilized in the drawer machines provides a 20 percent savings in the natural gas consumption of machinery in the production facility. Thanks to this system, the monthly gas consumption of Dynamo has been reduced from 98,000 Nm3 to 85,000 Nm3.<br><br>
	  			
	  			<strong>Wastewater Purification System:</strong> The wastewater purification system in Dynamo’s production facility is a biological purification system that purifies water by a certain extent, thus reducing the chances of harm to the environment. Although its economic cost is higher than that of other systems, when successfully installed this system performs with 95 percent efficiency.
	  			In line with the company’s environmental policies, Dynamo uses very small amounts of chemicals in its production facility. Chemicals are only used for two production phases: neutralization and mud dehydration.<br><br>
	  			
	  			<strong>Cooling Water Recovery System:</strong> The cooling water recovery system transports the cooling water from the facility to a soft water storage depot. Due to this system, daily water consumption has been decreased by up to 250 m3 .
