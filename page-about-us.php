	  		<p>With its 15 thousand square meters production and dyeing facility situated on 75 thousand square meters of land, Dynamo manufactures 12 million meters of fabric annually.<br><br>
	  		
	  		Personnel who are qualified and experienced in state-of-the-art systems work with the materials chosen for use at the facility. This is the secret behind the high-quality fabrics manufactured by Dynamo. <br><br>
	  		
	  		The operation of the facility is based on a three-shift system, and offers reactive, sulphur-based, indigo, and antique dyeing services.<br><br>
	  		
	  	 
	  		
	  		The main elements which distinguish this brand are naturally-mixed and cotton fabrics. <br><br>
	  		
	  		Fashion is a discipline that requires continuous rebirth. Globally, Dynamo has been offering trendsetting collections since 1991, and the company owes its success to its experienced team, its innovative perspective, and its cutting-edge multi-cultural designers.<br><br>
	  		
	  		
	  		For more than 20 years, Dynamo has prioritized both customer and employee satisfaction. The company’s 200 contract employees, high-quality production capacity, investments in technological infrastructure, and effective supply chain management, have enabled the company to sustain its success.<br><br>
	  		
	  		Quality, flexibility, and a strong sense of responsibility to its customers…<br><br>
	  		
	  		By investing in a fabric dyeing and production facility in Luleburgaz, Dynamo has made it possible for experienced, qualified personnel to work with quality raw material while using state-of-the-art production technology, and to manufacture products of the highest quality.<br><br>
	  		
	  		The ready-made group established by the brand in 2009, nearly 20 years ago, makes it possible to deliver timely, first-class service to leading textile firms.
